# Parkinsons-Classifier
Testing out various machine learning algorithms to predict whether or not a person has Parkinson's disease based on their speech/voice measurements.

# Future Idea:
Creating a web app that takes voice samples as inputs and determines whether or not the speaker has Parkinson's.
This would require that I get access to the voice recording software used to create the dataset.
